# node-generator

This is a bunch of js to make a professional ReadME generator, it took me a whilee bc I was stuck on the node index.js because it said it couldnt find inquierer module; turns out I just forgot to run the install. It was driving me crazy, anywho, this was actually quite fun and I liked doing stuff that I could actually see the result of in the actual machine, very cool.
